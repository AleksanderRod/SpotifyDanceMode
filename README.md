# Spotify Dance Mode Prediction Project
This project explores and models danceability in music using Spotify's dataset. It applies data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and advanced machine learning techniques to predict the danceability of songs. A slide deck and final report are also included for presentations and insights.

## Objectives

- Analyze the features influencing a song's danceability.
- Preprocess Spotify music data for machine learning.
- Build a predictive model to classify songs as danceable or not.
- Evaluate performance using metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and AUC.

## Methods and Tools

- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, LightGBM
- **Techniques**: 
  - Data cleaning & transformation
  - Feature selection
  - Model training & evaluation
  - Hyperparameter tuning
- **Visualization**: Exploratory graphs, correlation heatmaps, performance plots

## Results

The final model achieved high classification performance with optimized parameters using LightGBM. Important features included energy, tempo, loudness, and valence. Visual and statistical insights are provided in the accompanying report and slide deck.

## Files to Explore
